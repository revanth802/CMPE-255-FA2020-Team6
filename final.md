## Abstract:

The project analyzes tweets to get a better understanding of the difference between the Covid and In-Covid social media activity of people.The COVID-19 Pandemic has shifted and changed our day to day lives in a very exponential manner. While it is difficult to measure this due to the lack of everyday data of people’s lives, social media can provide us little insight into people’s emotions, spending habits, and actions. Twitter was selected due to its popularity and a common platform for people to express their emotions, share actions, and activities. We have used various clustering techniques to analyze tweets including K-Means, DB Scan, Gaussian, BIRCH, etc. Clustering provided insights into trending topics and a clear demarcation between them during the pre-covid and in-covid time period.
