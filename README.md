## Project Title: 
Clustering Based Behavioral and Social Insights w.r.t Pandemic 

## Data Source:
The data we will be using is the real-time tweets fetched from Twitter. We will get the tweets using “Tweepy”, an API for twitter-streaming from where we can access the tweets which we import into a pandas data frame. After this, we can perform the required steps to proceed with the project.
We will be focusing mainly on the tweets from the year 2019 and 2020 for this project. The link to the Tweepy API must be done by getting access from the official twitter developers website specified: https://developer.twitter.com/en

# Description of the problem to be investigated:
The COVID-19 Pandemic has shifted and changed our day to day lives in a very exponential manner. While it is difficult to measure this due to lack of everyday data of people’s lives, social media can provide us little insight into people’s emotions, spending habits, and actions.
Tweets can be broadly categorized in the following topics : 
- Activities
- Product Reviews
- Emotions
- Opinions about Social Topics
  
By analyzing tweets over the pre-COVID and in-COVID time period, we hope to cluster tweets based on similarity or correlation into topics that were most trending during the entire duration. Comparing these clusters, we can identify the difference between pandemic and non-pandemic time periods.
